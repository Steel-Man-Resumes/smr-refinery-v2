BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT
I have a felony conviction from 2012 (non-violent, possession charge). I was 19 and made a bad choice. I've been working steady since 2014, passed every drug test, and stayed out of trouble. My current employer knows about my background and trusts me to train new people. I'm looking for a company that judges me on my work, not my worst day 14 years ago.

Available upon request (3 supervisors ready to vouch for reliability and leadership potential)
